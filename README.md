# My approach to solve Advent of Code 2023 tasks.

I am not planning to solve all tasks in time. As you can see, I started 9 days before Christmas. However, I have both desire and need in this years AOC.
I use Python as my main professional language. I might really need Go on my forecoming job. And I have constant interest in Haskell. So I'll try to solve AOC for all these 3 languages.
But this impacts my velocity in a negative way. 
Anyway, I hope it will be usefull and interesting for you to browse my solutions!
